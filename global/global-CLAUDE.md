# Global CLAUDE Baseline (Compatibility)

Canonical global baseline:
@.ai_ops/global/global-MASTER.md

Context bootstrap requirement (when present in repo):
@docs/CONTEXT.md
@docs/CONTRIBUTING.md
@docs/APPLICATION_BLUEPRINT.md

Read these at agent startup and on every context refresh.

Use this compatibility file only for legacy setups.
For current setups, CLAUDE.md should point directly to `.ai_ops/global/global-MASTER.md`.
