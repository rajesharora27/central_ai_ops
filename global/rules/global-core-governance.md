# Global Core Governance

- Respect repository boundaries and existing conventions.
- Keep implementations deterministic and observable.
- Do not hide failures; surface blockers with concrete evidence.
- Prefer explicit contracts over implicit coupling.
- Keep tool-specific wrappers thin and delegate policy to shared rule files.
- At session start and every context refresh, read `/docs/CONTEXT.md`, `/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `/docs/APPLICATION_BLUEPRINT.md` when those files exist in the project.
